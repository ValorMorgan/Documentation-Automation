# Documentation-Automation
C# Code for Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word and Excel classes for creating documents.  Also a sidebar element to work with that can estimate from any number of elements being worked on.

## Remarks
This is a fairly old project that could use a good deal of refactoring.  I may revisit this in the future to improve it.
